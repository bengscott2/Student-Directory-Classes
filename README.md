# Student Directory #

The student directory script allows you to manage the list of students enrolled at Villains Academy.

This is a remake of my original Student Directory project. This version is reorganized into multiple files and classes.

## How to use ##

Install required Gems with

```shell
bundle install
```
Then to run the program use

```shell
ruby main.rb
```
